# 100Devs_projects Software Engineering Bootcamp
## Class 01 | HTML basics
The following notes and summary are drawn from the transcript of the first class of the **#100Devs software engineering bootcamp**, which focuses on transitioning into a career in web development through structured learning and community support.

### **Summary**
The instructor emphasizes that while software engineering is a high-paying and happy career that does not require a degree, it is exceptionally difficult and requires a specific mindset to survive the **"Trough of Sorrow"**—the period where many learners give up. The class covers the basic mechanics of the internet (request/response cycles), the essential roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and scientifically proven study methods like **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition**.

### **The Web Development Workflow**
The sources define the technical and professional workflow for an aspiring developer as follows:

*   **The Technical Request-Response Cycle:**
    *   **The Client:** A device (phone, laptop) running a browser makes a request for information.
    *   **DNS (Domain Name Server):** Acts as a "phone book" that translates a URL (like facebook.com) into an IP address to locate the correct server.
    *   **The Server:** A computer that "serves" the requested files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) back to the client.
    *   **Rendering:** The browser opens these files to display the content (HTML), apply styling (CSS), and enable interaction (JavaScript).
*   **The Career Transition Workflow:**
    *   **Phase 1: Learn the basics** of front-end and back-end development.
    *   **Phase 2: Build** a large-scale passion project and freelance for real clients.
    *   **Phase 3: Network** aggressively while transitioning into "interview mode".

### **Essential Tools**
*   **Text Editors:** Recommended tools for writing code include **Atom**, **VS Code**, or **Sublime Text**.
*   **Browsers:** **Chrome** or **Firefox** are the preferred environments for testing and rendering web pages.
*   **Community & Materials:** **Discord** is used for hosting all starter code, slides, and peer support. **Twitter** is utilized for attendance "check-ins" and as a primary tool for professional networking.
*   **Learning & Retention:** 
    *   **Anki:** A flashcard app that uses an algorithm to automate **Spaced Repetition** and flatten the "forgetting curve".
    *   **Coursera:** Students are assigned the "Learning How to Learn" course to master study techniques.
*   **Version Control:** **GitHub** is the future destination for storing code and submitting homework via pull requests.

### **Guidelines**
*   **Separation of Concerns:** This is the "Golden Rule." Content must stay in HTML, styling in CSS, and behavior in JavaScript. Never mix them.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Choose HTML tags based on their **meaning and importance** (e.g., using an `<h1>` for the most important heading), not based on how they look in the browser.
*   **Networking Strategy:** The sources state that **"clicking apply is like lighting your resume on fire."** Instead, students must network their way into positions through "coffee chats" and referrals.
*   **Effective Study Habits:** Stop highlighting and rereading. Use **Active Recall** (quizzing yourself on material) and **Spaced Repetition** (reviewing at increasing intervals) to learn faster and retain information permanently.
*   **Frustration Management:** Success in coding is a reflection of how one handles being stuck. It is a marathon, and learners must prioritize **sleep and self-care** to consolidate knowledge.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Coding is Not Enough:** Learning the technical skill is the "easy" part; the hard part of getting a job is the **networking and interviewing**.
*   **Consistency is Vital:** You are better off doing **20 minutes of work every single day** than trying to cram for five hours once a week.
*   **Full-Stack Strategy:** The goal is to become a "Full Stack" developer, meaning you can handle both the **front-end** (client-side) and **back-end** (server-side) of an application.
*   **Security Matters:** Understand that **HTTPS** is the secure version of the transfer protocol that encrypts data between the client and server.
*   **Community Support:** Having a community to help you get "unstuck" is the primary factor that prevents learners from quitting.

## Class 02 | More about HTML
This session focuses on the structural layer of the web, emphasizing the relationship between clients and servers and the correct use of HTML tags. 

### Workflow:
- Active Engagement: Rather than passive re-watching, students are encouraged to engage with the material once and then apply it immediately. 
- Coding by Hand: Avoid shortcuts and plugins initially; type out all tags to build muscle memory and a deeper understanding of syntax. 
- Study Method: Use "Anki" (flashcards) for active recall, specifically focusing on short questions with detailed answers. 

### Tools:
- HTML: Used to power the structure and content of a webpage. 
- MDN (Mozilla Developer Network): A primary reference for looking up documentation and tag usage. 
- **Anki: A tool for space repetition to reinforce learning.**

### Guidelines:
- Separation of Concerns: Keep content (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) separate. 
- Semantic HTML: Use tags like <strong> and <em> instead of just bolding or italics because they provide meaning to screen readers and search engines. 
- **Accessibility: Code should be readable by general users, assistive devices, and search engines alike.**

### Key Takeaways:
- Master the syntax (spelling, grammar, and punctuation of code) to avoid common errors. 
- Understand the client-server model as the fundamental communication path of the web.

## Class 03 | CSS

This session transitions into the styling layer of web development, introducing CSS syntax and advanced learning strategies. 

### Workflow:
- Mastery-Based Learning: Do not move on to a new topic until the current one is fully mastered. 
- Debugging: When CSS breaks, check for missing semicolons, colons between properties/values, or unclosed curly braces. 
- Project Structure: Organize files clearly, such as keeping CSS files in a dedicated folder relative to the HTML file. 

### Tools:
- CSS: The technology used for coloring, styling, and making websites look good. 
- Atom Editor: A text editor used for writing and managing code files. 
- Discord: Used for community support and accessing learning materials. 

### Guidelines:
- Floats vs. Modern Layouts: Learn "floats" to understand legacy codebases, but prioritize Flexbox and Grid for modern development. 
- Specificity & !important: Use the !important tag only as a last resort in emergencies (e.g., during a client meeting) and fix the underlying specificity issue afterward. 
- Research First: Exhaustive research is expected before asking for help in community channels. 

### Key Takeaways:
- CSS follows a cascading nature; errors in one line can cause all subsequent styles to break.
- Deep learning and honesty with the material (e.g., through reading Shay Howe) are more effective than rushing.
